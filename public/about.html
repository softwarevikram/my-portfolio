  In the personal front, I'm more attracted towards art. The most attracted art
  forms for me are music, dance and temple architecture. My hobbies are reading
  and gardening. To refresh myself and whenever I get a long week-end, I would
  love to travel and observe the culture and heritage of different regions of
  people. To capture those moments I also learned photography and have couple of
  gears at the moment.

  As a human, still trying to understand the purpose of my life.
